In addition to assisting researchers with their research, we also develop tools to assist with various tasks (primarily statistical and reporting). In the spirit of open science, we share these tools on various sharing platforms.

## R packages

R is one of the two main statistical programming languages used at CTU Bern. During out work, we have developed the following packages for various tasks.

###  [`accrualPlot`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/accrualPlot) <img src='https://github.com/CTU-Bern/accrualPlot/raw/main/man/figures/sticker.png' align="right" height="150">

With `accrualPlot`, it is easy to depict recruitment in a manner similar to a cumulative incidence curve, as a bar plot or to estimate the time point at which a given number of participants will be been enrolled.

More information on `accrualPlot` is available [here](https://ctu-bern.github.io/accrualPlot).

###  [`btabler`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/btabler) <img src='https://github.com/CTU-Bern/btabler/raw/main/man/figures/sticker.png' align="right" height="150">

`btabler` is a wrapper around the [`xtable`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/) package allowing more optimized tables for use in LaTeX reports.

More information on `btabler` is available [here](https://ctu-bern.github.io/btabler/).

### [`HSAr`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/HSAr)

`HSAr` is a by-product of CTU Bern's involvement in the SNFs [Smarter Health Case National Research Programme (NRP74)](http://www.nfp74.ch/en/Pages/Home.aspx). It provides an approach for creating so-called Hospital Service Areas - aggregated areas supposed to reflect the patterns of flow from people live to where they go to hospital. The method is described [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6773.13275). (The main repository is [here](https://github.com/aghaynes/HSAr))

### [`kpitools`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/kpitools) <!-- <img src='https://github.com/CTU-Bern/kpitools/man/figures/sticker.png' align="right" height="200"> -->

`kpitools` is for risk based monitoring. It provides a consistent approach to calculating and reporting quality indicators (i.e. Key Performance Indicators, KPIs).

### [`presize`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/presize) <!-- <img src='https://github.com/CTU-Bern/presize/man/figures/sticker.png' align="right" height="200"> -->

`presize` is a package for precision based sample size calculations. Rather than having a specific hypothesis to test, a trial might be rather aimed at estimating the magnitude of a effect and want to have an estimate with a certain precision (e.g. 'how wide would my confidence interval be with so-and-so many participants?', or 'how many participants would be required to attain a confidence interval so wide?'). 

`presize` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/presize) and an user-friendly, non-programmatic version of the application is available [here](https://shiny.ctu.unibe.ch/presize/).


## Stata

Stata is the second programming language primarily used at CTU Bern. Again, we have developed various codes that may be of general interest to users.

### [`btable`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/btable) <img src='https://github.com/CTU-Bern/btable/raw/main/sticker.png' align="right" height="150">

`btable` makes creating baseline tables simple in Stata. It is a very flexible approach used by most statisticians at CTU Bern, even those that primarily use R for their analyses.

### [`stata_secutrial`](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/stata_secutrial)

This repository contains code for reading secuTrial data into Stata and does a lot of preparatory tasks such as labelling variables and formatting dates.


## Other packages...

CTU Bern was also actively involved in programming the [`secuTrialR`](https://github.com/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR) package for loading secuTrial datasets in to R.
